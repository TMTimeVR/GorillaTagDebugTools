# This mod enables the "hidden" debug guis in Gorilla Tag for nerds to do things.

If you are Lemming and you don't want this mod to be available, please DM me on Discord (tmtimevr).
I have a "kill switch" which basically shutsdown the entire mod.

If you are a player and you are thinking about using this mod, I don't know if you will be banned.
Continue with caution.
